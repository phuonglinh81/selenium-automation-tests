# selenium-automation-tests
## Overview
This repository contains automated tests for a simple web application using Selenium WebDriver. The application allows users to log in and manage a product list, including adding, searching, and displaying products. The tests ensure the functionality works as expected across different scenarios.
## Test Cases
This section ensures the application functions correctly by testing key features. Each test case verifies proper error handling and ensures accurate feedback for users.
- Login Tests: Verifying valid and invalid user login scenarios.
- Product Addition: Testing product addition with valid and invalid inputs.
- Product Search: Ensuring the search functionality works for different queries.
## Selenium IDE
Selenium IDE was used to record and generate some of the test cases. The tests have been further refined and implemented using Python and pytest.
## Results 
Tests are executed in a local environment with results displayed in the console. Successful test passes will be shown, along with assertions for error handling.
## Link ChatGPT
Here is the link to my ChatGPT conversation where an example of running Selenium tests was provided. You can review it to understand the implementation and testing process better. Additionally, I asked ChatGPT to evaluate and grade my automation testing exercises. I made adjustments based on the suggestions provided to improve the results of my tests.
